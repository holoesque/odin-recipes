          <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
              <li>4 skinless, boneless, chicken breast halves</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow
                  baking dish; add chicken breast and turn to coat. Cover the dish
                  with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to 
                  overnight.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Preheat an outdoor grilll for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard 
                  remaining marinade.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the
                  center and the juices run clear, about 7 to 8 minutes on each
                  side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
                  read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

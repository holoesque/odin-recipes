        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless, chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow
                baking dish; add chicken breast and turn to coat. Cover the dish
                with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to 
                overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat an outdoor grilll for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard 
                remaining marinade.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the
                center and the juices run clear, about 7 to 8 minutes on each
                side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
                read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

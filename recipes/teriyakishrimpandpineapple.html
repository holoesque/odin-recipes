            These savory-sweet shrimp skewers are east to make and cook in just
            a few minutes. They are perfect for summer weeknights or weekend 
            dinner parties. Prep the sauce ahjead of time for an even faster dinner.
            I prefer to use jumbo shrimp (21 to 25 per pound>, however use what
            you have on hand.
